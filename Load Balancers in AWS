# What is Load Balancer?What are the types of load balancers?

Load balancer is a service used to route the incoming traffic across all servers equally that are capable of fulfilling those requests in a manner that maximizes speed and
capacity utilization. The load balancer ensures that no one server is overloded with the traffic.

# Types of load balancers? And difference between them.

* Application Load Balancer (ALB): Layer 7

  ALB supports HTTP, HTTPS and Web socket traffic.

  Allows load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across different machines and same machines (EC2).

  The application servers don't see the client's ip directly.

* Network Load balancer (NLB): Layer 4

   It works at transport layer.

   It forwards TCP/UDP traffic to instances.

   Handles millions of requests per second.

   It has one static IP per AZ.

When clients send requests over the internet, the traffic is directed to a load balancer, which then distributes it across multiple servers to achieve load balancing.
